# *** Probability Concepts**

## **1. Introduction to Probability**
Probability is a branch of mathematics that deals with the likelihood or chance of events occurring. It is used in various fields such as statistics, data science, and machine learning to make predictions and decisions. The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1, where:
- **0** represents an impossible event.
- **1** represents a certain event.

### **Key Terms in Probability**
- **Experiment**: A process or action that leads to a single outcome (e.g., tossing a coin, rolling a die).
- **Outcome**: A possible result of an experiment (e.g., "Heads" when tossing a coin).
- **Sample Space (SS)**: The set of all possible outcomes in an experiment.  
  Example: For a coin toss, SS = {Heads, Tails}.
- **Event (A)**: A subset of outcomes from the sample space.  
  Example: When rolling a die, the event of getting an even number is A = {2, 4, 6}.

## **2. Types of Probability**
### **Classical Probability**
Classical probability assumes all outcomes in the sample space are equally likely. It is used when the total number of outcomes is finite and known.
Example: Rolling a fair die → P(getting 3) = 1/6.

### **Empirical Probability**
Empirical probability is based on observed data from experiments. It is calculated by dividing the number of times an event occurs by the total number of trials.
Example: If a coin is tossed 100 times and Heads occurs 55 times, the empirical probability of getting Heads is P(Heads) = 55/100 = 0.55.

### **Subjective Probability**
Subjective probability is based on personal judgment or experience, rather than empirical data or formal calculations.
Example: Predicting the likelihood of success for a new business venture.

## **3. Basic Rules of Probability**
### **Addition Rule**
The probability of the union of two events A and B is given by:  
P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A ∩ B)  
If events A and B are mutually exclusive (i.e., they cannot happen at the same time), then:  
P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B).

### **Multiplication Rule**
The probability of both events A and B occurring (their intersection) is given by:  
P(A ∩ B) = P(A) ⋅ P(B | A)  
If events A and B are independent, the multiplication rule simplifies to:  
P(A ∩ B) = P(A) ⋅ P(B).

### **Complement Rule**
The probability of an event not occurring (denoted by Ac) is:  
P(A^c) = 1 − P(A).

## **4. Conditional Probability**
Conditional probability is the probability of an event A occurring given that event B has already occurred. It is calculated as:  
P(A | B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), where P(B) ≠ 0.

Example:  
In a deck of cards, if we know a card is a face card, the probability that it is a King is:  
P(King | Face Card) = 4/12 = 1/3.

## **5. Bayes' Theorem**
Bayes' Theorem provides a way to update the probability of an event based on new information. It is expressed as:  
P(A | B) = (P(B | A) ⋅ P(A)) / P(B).

Example:  
If a medical test has:
- P(Positive | Disease) = 0.98 (the probability of a positive test result given that the person has the disease),
- P(Positive | No Disease) = 0.05 (the probability of a positive test result given that the person does not have the disease),
- P(Disease) = 0.01 (the prior probability of having the disease),  
then we can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate P(Disease | Positive), the probability of having the disease given a positive test result.

## **6. Random Variables**
A random variable is a function that assigns a numerical value to each outcome of a random experiment.  
- **Discrete Random Variable**: Takes specific values (e.g., number of heads in three coin tosses).
- **Continuous Random Variable**: Takes any value within a range (e.g., height, weight, or temperature).

## **7. Probability Distributions**
### **PMF (Probability Mass Function)**
The PMF is used for discrete random variables. It gives the probability of a random variable taking a specific value.  
Example: P(X = x) for discrete random variables.

### **PDF (Probability Density Function)**
The PDF is used for continuous random variables. It represents the probability distribution as a density function, where probabilities are determined by integrating the PDF over a specific range.  
Example: P(a ≤ X ≤ b) = ∫(a to b) f(x) dx for continuous random variables.

## **8. Expectation and Variance**
### **Expectation (Mean)**
The expected value of a random variable is the long-term average value it takes on over numerous trials.
- For discrete variables: E(X) = ∑x ⋅ P(X = x).
- For continuous variables: E(X) = ∫(−∞ to ∞) x ⋅ f(x) dx.

### **Variance**
Variance measures the spread of a distribution. It quantifies how much the values of a random variable deviate from the expected value.
- For variance: Var(X) = E(X²) − [E(X)]².

## **9. Important Theorems**
### **Law of Large Numbers**
The Law of Large Numbers states that as the number of trials increases, the sample mean will converge to the expected value of the random variable.

### **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**
The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of the sum (or mean) of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the original distribution of the variables.

## **10. Key Probability Distributions**
### **Binomial Distribution**
The Binomial Distribution describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials, each with the same probability of success.  
PMF: P(X = k) = (n choose k) ⋅ p^k ⋅ (1 − p)^(n − k).

### **Normal Distribution**
The Normal Distribution is a continuous distribution that is symmetric around the mean. It is often used to model real-world phenomena.  
PDF: f(x) = (1 / √(2πσ²)) ⋅ e^−((x − μ)² / 2σ²).

### **Poisson Distribution**
The Poisson Distribution models the number of times an event occurs within a fixed interval of time or space.  
PMF: P(X = k) = (λ^k e^−λ) / k!, where λ is the average rate of occurrence.

## Unit II: Stochastic Processes

### 1. Poisson Process
A **Poisson process** is a stochastic process that models random events occurring at a constant average rate over time. It is useful for modeling scenarios where events happen independently and at a fixed average rate.

#### Key Features:
- Events occur one at a time.
- The probability of more than one event occurring in an infinitesimally small time interval is negligible.
- The number of events in a fixed time period is random, but the average number of events is constant.

#### Formula:
The probability of observing exactly **k** events in time **t** is given by the Poisson distribution:
\[
P(X(t) = k) = \frac{(\lambda t)^k e^{-\lambda t}}{k!}
\]
Where:
- \(\lambda\) is the average rate of events per unit time.
- \(t\) is the time period.
- \(k\) is the number of events.

#### Example:
For a call center where the average rate of calls is 3 per minute, the probability of receiving exactly 2 calls in 1 minute is:
\[
P(X(1) = 2) = \frac{(3 \times 1)^2 e^{-3 \times 1}}{2!} = \frac{9 e^{-3}}{2} \approx 0.2241
\]

### 2. Discrete-Time Markov Chains (DTMC)
A **Discrete-Time Markov Chain** (DTMC) is a stochastic process that evolves in discrete steps over time. The key property is the **memoryless** nature, meaning that the future state depends only on the current state and not on how it arrived at that state.

#### Key Features:
- The process transitions through states at discrete time steps.
- The future state depends only on the current state.

#### Transition Probability Matrix:
A **transition probability matrix** describes the probability of transitioning from one state to another.

Example:
For a weather model with two states: Sunny (S1) and Rainy (S2), the transition matrix is:
\[
P = \begin{bmatrix} 0.8 & 0.2 \\ 0.4 & 0.6 \end{bmatrix}
\]
This matrix means:
- If it's Sunny (S1) today, there's an 80% chance it will be Sunny tomorrow and a 20% chance it will be Rainy.
- If it's Rainy (S2) today, there's a 40% chance it will be Sunny tomorrow and a 60% chance it will remain Rainy.

#### Stationary Distribution:
The stationary distribution is a distribution of states that remains constant over time. To find the stationary distribution \(\pi\), solve the equation:
\[
\pi = \pi P
\]
Where \(\pi = [\pi_1, \pi_2]\) is the stationary distribution vector.

### 3. Continuous-Time Markov Process
In a **Continuous-Time Markov Process**, transitions between states happen continuously rather than in discrete steps. The rate of transition is defined by a rate parameter.

#### Example: Birth-Death Process
In a **birth-death process**, the population of a species increases (birth) or decreases (death) at random rates, represented by \(\lambda\) (birth rate) and \(\mu\) (death rate).

### 4. Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
A **Hidden Markov Model** (HMM) is a Markov process with hidden states, where we observe some outputs related to the state but do not directly observe the state.

#### Example:
Consider a situation where the weather is hidden (either Sunny or Rainy), and the observations are whether people are carrying an umbrella.

- Hidden states: Weather (Sunny or Rainy)
- Observations: Whether people are carrying an umbrella or not

### Key Concepts Summary:
- **Poisson Process**: Models events occurring at a constant rate over time.
- **Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC)**: A process where future states depend only on the current state.
- **Continuous-Time Markov Process**: A process with continuous time intervals and random transitions.
- **Hidden Markov Model (HMM)**: A Markov process with hidden states inferred based on observable outputs.

## Unit III: Monte Carlo Simulation

Monte Carlo simulations use random sampling or probability to solve complex problems. They are especially useful for estimating the solutions of problems that involve uncertainty.

### 1. Random Number Generation

#### Uniform Random Numbers:
Each number within a defined range is equally likely to be chosen. Example: Rolling a fair die.

#### Non-Uniform Random Numbers:
Numbers are not equally likely, and some outcomes are weighted. Example: Rolling a weighted die.

### 2. Random Variable Generation

#### Inverse Transform Method:
This method generates random variables that follow a specific distribution by transforming a uniformly distributed random number.

**Formula**:
\[
X = -\frac{\ln(1 - U)}{\lambda}
\]
Where \(U\) is a uniformly distributed random number between 0 and 1, and \(\lambda\) is the rate parameter.

#### Rejection Sampling:
This method involves generating random variables from a simple distribution and accepting or rejecting them based on how well they fit the target distribution.

### 3. Monte Carlo Method
The **Monte Carlo Method** involves solving a problem by running multiple random simulations and averaging the results.

#### Example: Estimating the Area of a Circle
1. Draw a square and inscribe a circle.
2. Randomly throw points inside the square.
3. Count how many points fall inside the circle.
4. The ratio of points inside the circle to total points estimates the area of the circle.

### 4. Monte Carlo Integration
Monte Carlo integration estimates the value of an integral using random sampling. This is useful when the integral is difficult or impossible to solve analytically.

#### Steps:
1. Define the function to integrate.
2. Randomly select points from the integration range.
3. Count how many points fall under the curve.
4. Use the ratio of points under the curve to total points to estimate the integral.

### Key Concepts Summary:
- **Random Number Generation**: Creating random numbers using uniform and non-uniform methods.
- **Random Variable Generation**: Using methods like inverse transform and rejection sampling to generate variables.
- **Monte Carlo Method**: Solving problems through random simulations.
- **Monte Carlo Integration**: Using random sampling to estimate integrals.

## Unit IV: Information Theory

Information Theory deals with quantifying and communicating information efficiently.

### 1. Shannon Entropy
**Shannon Entropy** measures the uncertainty or randomness in a set of information. It quantifies the information produced by a source.

#### Formula:
\[
H(X) = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i) \log_2 P(x_i)
\]
Where:
- \(H(X)\) is the entropy of the random variable \(X\),
- \(P(x_i)\) is the probability of each outcome.

#### Example:
For a fair coin:
\[
H(X) = -[0.5 \log_2 0.5 + 0.5 \log_2 0.5] = 1 \text{ bit}
\]
Each coin flip produces 1 bit of information.

### 2. Relative Entropy (Kullback-Leibler Divergence)
**Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence** measures how different two probability distributions are.

#### Formula:
\[
D_{\text{KL}}(P \parallel Q) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i) \log_2 \frac{P(x_i)}{Q(x_i)}
\]
Where:
- \(P(x_i)\) is the true probability distribution,
- \(Q(x_i)\) is the approximated distribution.

### 3. Mutual Information
**Mutual Information (MI)** quantifies the amount of information shared between two variables, measuring how much knowing one variable reduces the uncertainty of the other.

#### Formula:
\[
I(X;Y) = H(X) + H(Y) - H(X,Y)
\]
Where:
- \(I(X;Y)\) is the mutual information between \(X\) and \(Y\),
- \(H(X)\), \(H(Y)\), and \(H(X,Y)\) are the entropies of the individual and joint distributions.
